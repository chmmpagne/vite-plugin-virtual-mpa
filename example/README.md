# vite-plugin-virtual-mpa-demo

# CodeSandbox

Hello everyone, this is a demostration about how can you use the plugin. You can customize the vite config to reach whatever you want.

Click here [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/vite-plugin-virtual-mpa-0djylc) for a quick experience.

Click the link within the container's page and check the log from console for a development preview. Also you can open in a new tab for a further experience because it seems like the actual url won't sync with container's url immediately.

You can click `+` in the top right corner of the console to open an operable terminal, and then execute `yarn build` to build resource into `dist`.

# Local Running

This example project works on pnpm's workspace protocol. If you wanna have a local experience with pnpm, you should cd into `'workspaces/plugin'` directory and **execute build command first**. But it doesn't matter if you work with yarn or npm.

Have a gooooood experience!
